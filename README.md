        <h2> A Brief History of Computing </h2>
        <p> Humans are natural innovators and have been designing tools that make tasking easier quite literally since the dawn of time. The history of computers dates back centuries, with an endless winding road to what we know as computer today long before most people were born. But enough with the historical stuff — first thing is first: What exactly is a “computer”?</p>
        <p> A computer is an electronic device that performs a number of different information-processing tasks. The Jacquard loom, for example, was an early implementaion of a system that automated weaving based upon punch cards created to carry out predefined actions in the fabric but it did not perform any calculations. Likewise the Apsa (abacus has been wonderful for mathematics, however it was not programmable). Mechanical dolls called automata, which were 18th-century devices created by Pierre Jaquet-Droz,far from even being able to perform calculations let alone classify as a computer. </p>
        <p> Charles Babbage was probably the true pioneer in this area with real break-through occurring in 19th century. He named his inventions like the Difference Engine and Analytical Engine, an even more sophisticated tool programmable through punched cards. While these machines were never completed, Babbage is considered the "father of modern computing."
        We came of age with the arrival of general-purpose digital computers in 1943, like ENIAC. It could be set to execute different procedures, which is the introduction of our digital area. Since that time computers have come a long, very long and what were some early design by Babbage in to modern computer. </p>
        <h2> The Evolution of Programming </h2>
        <p> Programing gradually evolved together with computers. Ada Lovelace, Countess of LuvLetos — a direct descendant of George Gordon Byronand the only legitimate child form his marriage to Annabel Ivey- who worked with Babbage is considered thé first Programmer in die world. Ada wrote the first algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine and suggested that it might be possible to write algorithms eventually able to compose art, or music. </p>
        <p> The first form of a computer program was informally called "machine code". When computers became more powerful, easier programming languages were needed. Short Code was among the first high-level languages invented (1953), and the earliest for which compilers were developed. People could write instructions in a slightly more human-friendly manner, and then the computer hardware would map these to machine code. </p>
        <p> IBM released the first commonly used high-level programming language in 1954, known as Fortran. The 1950s saw the births of some other enduring languages; Lisp, COBOL Thousands of programming languages have been created over the years, each allowing us to communicate in more complex terms with computers.</p>
        <h2> What is IT? </h2>
        <p> Nowadays Information Technology (IT) is in all places around us. IT is always there whether you are on phone or Computer. But what exactly is IT? <br> IT is a term that represents all forms of technology used to create, store, exchange information in its various forms. That could be as simple as a brief document or all the way up to global businesses. IT is a general term that refers to software, hardware as well as networking.</p>
        <h2> Hardware in IT </h2>
        <p> Computer hardware is the series of physical elements, or components. That also includes physical things you can touch, such as the keyboard and mouse, yes; but I specifically mean objects that become integrated into internal components like CPU (central processing unit), memory types or storage devices. It is the platform on which other programs run, Software acts as a source of support system that allow us to interact with computer. </p>
        <h2> Software in IT </h2>
        <p> The body is in hardware, the brain — at software. Software is the programs that run on your computer or device. It really is just split into two main categories: system software and application software. System software including operating systems ( Mac OS, Windows ) directs the hardware to work together and gives a base for it so that all application can be developed. Application software: programs such as Microsoft Word, games or web browsers that help carry out a specific task. </p>
        <h2> Networking in IT </h2>
        <p> Simply put, networking is a way for computers and devices to talk over networks. That network links perhaps two nearby computers and maybe millions of devices thousands of miles away access in the internet. When we connected with networking then it means now information can be shared online, webs will connect and online communication among peoples. Main network elements are routers, that enable communication among devices and pass the data from one location to another. </p>
        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <p> If you understand IT hardware, software and networking—except for all the new capabilities that come with Web 2. These concepts are vital for you irrespective of whether your planning to put in a career into technology or just want to know how things work. Considering the rapid evolution of technology, it is important for you to understand some kind of IT basics as this will go a long way in enabling you to move along with an ever-changing digital ecosystem. </p>
